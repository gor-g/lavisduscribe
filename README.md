# ðŸ§  Lavisduscribe

**Lavisduscribe** is a fine-tuned version of [HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-360M](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-360M) trained on the dataset [gor-g/philosophical-deflections](https://huggingface.co/datasets/gor-g/philosophical-deflections).

## ðŸª¶ Model Description

Lavisduscribe is designed **not** to answer questions directly â€” instead, it produces elaborate, pseudo-philosophical gibberish reminiscent of _Otis the Scribe_ from _Asterix & Obelix: Mission Cleopatra_.

The modelâ€™s goal is to **deflect any query** into verbose, dramatic, and meaningless reflections that sound profound but say very little.

"It can be seen as a parody or experimental text generator, exploring absurdism, verbosity, and meta-commentary in AI dialogue." (GPT-5 Mini, 24 october 2025)
